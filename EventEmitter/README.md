Javascript prototype and it's implementation in Node's Eventemitter

When a new object A is created, along with the Object A's properties if we need other object B's properties to be directly called from
Object A, then we add the object B as a prototype to Object A.

In the example js file, if we created a Greetr Object and used Node's inhertits propety to make the propeties of Eventemitter available
for Greetr Object
