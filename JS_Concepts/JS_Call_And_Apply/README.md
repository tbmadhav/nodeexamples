Javascript Call and Apply example

Call is used to call an object in Javascript.
	Call will take parameters which overrides the "this" object of the object the function we are calling
Apply is used for the same purpose as Call	
	But the difference between Call and Apply is that the Apply will take the rest of the parameters as an array
